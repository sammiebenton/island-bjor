A example of webscraping with the puppeteer library by Google.  Since Vinbuðin is the only place we can purchase beer, liqour, and wine...it´s an easy source to know what drinks in this country area available and where to buy them.  This will be my data model for my iceland beer finder app.  I had to throw in some recursion to get this app to scrape every product they sell.  It's not pretty and there is definitely some cleaning up to do.  It's always changing and they are always getting new and exciting beers and drinks daily.  I think I'll have to run this twice a day and link some realtime checks to it as they have the quanity of each drink updated in realtime.  Thats going to be tricky.
